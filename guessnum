# This program implements the Guess Your Number! game

# Write some code to ask for the maximum and minimum
# possible numbers to guess.

# Write some logic that decides on a guess and then prompts
# the user for whether that guess was (1) too low, (2) too
# high, or (3) correct.

# Give the program 5 guesses before it asks the user for the answer.\
